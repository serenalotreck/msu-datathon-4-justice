# msu-datathon-4-justice
MSU team's code for the QSIDE Datathon4Justice

There is a directory for each of the datasets. Inside each directory there are four sub-directories 

1. **original_data** : This has the data downloaded from the QSIDE website. It is good practice to never alter these files, as in don't open these manually and change them then overwrite them or change them programatically and then overwrite them
2. **generated_data** : This folder would contain addtional data files generated during the weekend
3. **src** : This is where all the scource code used to manipluate the data files would go
4. **results** : These are notebook type files that would display some results/insights generated from the data.
