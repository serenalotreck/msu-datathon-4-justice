    "# Narrative Analysis\n",
    "In the Williamstown police department data, there are frequently \"Narrative\" fields associated with each incident. We have several overarching questions regarding these narratives, which include:\n",
    "* Is there evidence of the \"boys will be boys\" culture instilled in the department by the previous police chief in the descriptions of incidents and interactions with people of varying demographic backgrounds and incident types? (e.g. do the narratives about noise complaints for parties differ from narratives about the police being called on a young woman?)\n",
    "* Is there evidence that third shift is being more problematic (more tickets, etc) than other shifts? (This question is prompted by the recent revelation that the cop with the Hitler photo in his locker had been leading third shift cops in illegal searches of racial justice activists in the town)\n",
    "* How much time in each shift is, on average, occupied by responding to calls? (This question is aimed at either supporting or disproving the hypothesis that there are too many cops in the department, and that potentially something like third shift could be handled by one on-call individual)\n",
    "* How often and for what types of incidents does Williamstown PD respond to incidents at Williams College? (The PD listens to the Williams College dispatch and responds if the incidents are sever enough/may affect the town itself)\n",
